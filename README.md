# PCA-algorithm-for-dimensionality-reduction

Visualization is a powerful tool for data exploration. But in the general case input dimension is high, so the visualisation is hard task. The dimension reduction is a method that allow to reduce data dimension for visualisation and for other purposes.


The goal of this netbook is to understand the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
